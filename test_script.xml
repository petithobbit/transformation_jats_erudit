                <alinea>As the population of the world continues to increase beyond 7 billion, and
                    agricultural pests continue to rapidly evolve resistance to pesticides, it is
                    becoming ever more important to cultivate arable land in a way that is
                    sustainable for both humans and the environment. A better understanding of the
                    different mechanisms used by wild plants to deter herbivores will help to
                    increase crop production without harming the environment.</alinea>
                <alinea>Plants use both direct and indirect methods to fend off herbivores. Direct
                    defense methods include the production of chemicals that are toxic to herbivores
                    or give them indigestion, and the growth of sticky prickles and spines that can
                    injure or kill the herbivore. Indirect defense methods, on the other hand,
                    generally rely on the plant attracting organisms that are either predators or
                    parasites of the herbivore.</alinea>
                <alinea>Plants produce odors known as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are
                    thought to offer indirect defense against herbivores by betraying their location
                    to predators and parasites. However, HIPVs also influence other members of the
                    ecological community, sometimes in ways that are detrimental to plants.gr
                    Moreover, despite 30 years of research, no study has demonstrated that HIPVs
                    increase the fitness of a plant, so it is unclear what they have evolved to
                    do.</alinea>
                <alinea>Now, a 2-year field study by Schuman <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.</marquage> has shown plants
                    that emit green leaf volatiles (which are a type of HIPV) produce twice as many
                    buds and flowers&#x2014;a measure of fitness&#x2014;as plants that have been genetically
                    engineered not to emit green leaf volatiles. This study was conducted with
                        <marquage typemarq="italique">Nicotiana attenuata</marquage>, which is a wild tobacco plant that is
                    often targeted by <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca sexta</marquage>, a type of moth that is also
                    known as the tobacco hornworm. Green leaf volatiles only increased plants'
                    fitness when various species of <marquage typemarq="italique">Geocoris</marquage>&#x2014;a bug that preys on
                        <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca sexta</marquage>&#x2014;reduced the number of herbivores by a factor
                    of two. This is the first evidence that HIPVs offer indirect defense against
                    herbivores.</alinea>
                <alinea>Schuman <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.</marquage> also studied the effects of molecules called
                    protease inhibitors that are thought to function as direct defenses by making it
                    difficult for herbivores to digest plants. They found that the ability to
                    produce protease inhibitors did not increase the fitness of plants under
                    herbivore attack; however, tobacco hornworms that had been fed plants containing
                    protease inhibitors were found to be more sluggish in response to attack, which
                    suggests that protease inhibitors can enhance the indirect defenses of plants.
                    The results suggest that employing both direct and indirect defenses&#x2014;such as a
                    combination of biological pesticides and genetic engineering to produce both
                    HIPVs and protease inhibitors&#x2014;is the best approach for defending agricultural
                    plants against pests.</alinea>

            <alinea>Plant indirect defenses are traits that disable or remove herbivores by manipulating
                tri-trophic interactions to the advantage of the plant (<renvoi idref="Price et al., 1980" typeref="refbiblio"/>). They attract and inform the third
                trophic level, predators or parasitoids, resulting in increased attacks on
                herbivores (<renvoi idref="Turlings and Wäckers, 2004" typeref="refbiblio"/>).
                Indirect defenses are widespread and include domatia, extrafloral nectar, and food
                bodies which provide shelter and nutrition for predators and parasitoids, as well as
                herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which convey information about feeding
                herbivores (<renvoi idref="Heil, 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>). Field studies with
                the native tobacco <marquage typemarq="italique">Nicotiana attenuata</marquage>, a desert annual, and with
                maize have shown that HIPVs can reduce herbivore loads by 24% to more than 90%, by
                increasing both predation and parasitization of herbivores (<renvoi idref="Kessler and Baldwin, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Rasmann et al., 2005" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Halitschke et&#xA;                    al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Degenhardt et al.,&#xA;                    2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Allmann and Baldwin, 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>)
                and deterring herbivore oviposition (<renvoi idref="Kessler and&#xA;                    Baldwin, 2001"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>).</alinea>
         </para>
            <para>
            <alinea>If HIPVs really function as defenses, they should increase Darwinian fitness, defined
                as successful reproduction, for plants under herbivore attack (<renvoi idref="Karban and Baldwin, 1997" typeref="refbiblio"/>). But because HIPVs can be perceived
                by many other members of the ecological community&#x2014;from herbivores, pollinators,
                predators and parasitoids to competing or parasitic plants&#x2014;it is not clear whether
                HIPVs increase plant fitness in nature (<renvoi idref="Dicke and&#xA;                    Baldwin, 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Kessler and Heil,&#xA;                    2011" typeref="refbiblio"/>). The field studies described above have either spanned too short a
                time to reveal Darwinian fitness benefits, or have not reported fitness data at all
                    (<renvoi idref="Kessler and Baldwin, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Rasmann et al., 2005" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Halitschke et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Degenhardt et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Allmann and&#xA;                    Baldwin, 2010"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>). Two laboratory studies showed that parasitization of
                herbivores can increase plant reproduction (<renvoi idref="van&#xA;                    Loon et al., 2000" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Hoballah and&#xA;                    Turlings, 2001"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>), but the parasitization in these studies was not mediated
                by HIPVs. Hence three decades after their description, it remains unclear whether
                HIPVs are really indirect defenses.</alinea>
         </para>
            <para>
            <alinea>Long-term field studies comparing HIPV-emitting vs -deficient plants are required in
                order to demonstrate a defensive function for HIPVs. Experimental additions of pure
                volatiles or mixes to plants growing in nature has worked well to test short-term
                effects of specific compounds (<renvoi idref="Kessler and&#xA;                    Baldwin, 2001"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Allmann and Baldwin,&#xA;                    2010"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>), but only endogenously produced HIPV emissions can ensure specific,
                lasting and consistent differences under field conditions. Most evidence for the
                utility of HIPVs comes from studies in which predators and parasitoids learn to
                associate HIPVs with prey; naïve predators and parasitoids are just as likely to
                respond to HIPVs as not to respond (<renvoi idref="Allison and&#xA;                    Hare, 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>). Thus the inducibility of HIPV emission, which ensures
                association with herbivore feeding, is likely essential for HIPV function, but it is
                difficult to engineer (<renvoi idref="Kos et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>).
                Engineered constitutive HIPV emissions have been used, either on predators and
                parasitoids trained to associate target volatiles with prey in short-term laboratory
                experiments (<renvoi idref="Kappers et al., 2005" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Schnee et al., 2006" typeref="refbiblio"/>), or in set-ups in which
                target volatiles are always associated with prey (<renvoi idref="Rasmann et al., 2005" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Degenhardt et&#xA;                    al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>). When plants are engineered constitutively to emit HIPVs, they
                no longer provide accurate information about the location of feeding herbivores, and
                predators will not associate these signals with prey in nature. Genetically
                silencing the biosynthesis of HIPVs, however, permits naturally inducible wild-type
                (WT) plants to serve as HIPV emitters, for comparison with transformed lines lacking
                specific volatile components (<renvoi idref="Halitschke et al.,&#xA;                    2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Skibbe et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>).
                Furthermore, field experiments that manipulate the production of HIPVs which not
                only attract the third trophic level, but also influence the second trophic level
                (e.g., as feeding stimulants and host location cues), require additional
                experimental manipulations to preserve the plant-herbivore part of the tritrophic
                interaction.</alinea>
         </para>
            <para>
            <alinea>When HIPVs do attract the third trophic level, how can herbivores adapt? Many
                herbivores can outgrow their vulnerability to predators and parasitoids, but plant
                direct defenses can slow herbivore growth and prolong vulnerability as postulated by
                the slow growth-high mortality hypothesis (<renvoi idref="Benrey&#xA;                    and Denno, 1997" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Williams, 1999" typeref="refbiblio"/>;
                    <renvoi idref="Kessler and Baldwin, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>, <renvoi idref="2004" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Kaplan and Thaler, 2011" typeref="refbiblio"/>). The solanaceous specialists <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca
                    sexta</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">M. quinquemaculata</marquage> (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae)
                are resistant to the potent alkaloid toxin nicotine (<renvoi idref="Wink and Theile, 2002" typeref="refbiblio"/>), but sensitive to the nutritional
                value of plant tissue (<renvoi idref="Zavala and Baldwin,&#xA;                    2004"
                       typeref="refbiblio"/>). Non-toxic protease inhibitor (PI) proteins, which inhibit protein
                digestion and thus decrease the availability of organic nitrogen in the form of
                amino acids (<renvoi idref="Zavala et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>), are
                widespread in flowering plants (<renvoi idref="Hartl et al.,&#xA;                    2011" typeref="refbiblio"/>), and trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs) slow the growth of
                    <marquage typemarq="italique">M. sexta</marquage> on <marquage typemarq="italique">N. attenuata</marquage> (<renvoi idref="Zavala et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>). However, herbivores can
                overcome PIs by producing insensitive or desensitized proteases, inactivating or
                degrading PIs, eating more plant tissue, and eating more nutritious young tissue
                    (<renvoi idref="Winterer and Bergelson, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Zavala et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>). In the latter two
                cases, PIs could reduce plant fitness. Although TPI-producing <marquage typemarq="italique">N.
                    attenuata</marquage> plants produce more seeds than TPI-deficient plants when
                attacked by <marquage typemarq="italique">M. sexta</marquage> under controlled glasshouse conditions (<renvoi idref="Zavala and Baldwin, 2004" typeref="refbiblio"/>), whether TPIs
                function as a direct defense in nature is unknown.</alinea>
         </para>
            <para>
            <alinea>We tested the hypotheses that HIPVs and TPIs defend plants in nature by increasing
                herbivore predation and thereby plant Darwinian fitness. To do so, we monitored the
                performance, predation and mortality of <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca</marquage> spp. (<marquage typemarq="italique">M.
                    sexta</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">M. quinquemaculata</marquage>) on wild-type <marquage typemarq="italique">N.
                    attenuata</marquage> plants and RNAi transformed lines silenced for the production
                either of a specific group of HIPVs, or of TPIs, and compared the resulting plant
                reproductive output in terms of bud and flower production (we are not permitted to
                allow transgenic plants to disperse ripe seed). Because <marquage typemarq="italique">N.
                    attenuata</marquage> is an annual, opportunistic out-crosser, seeds are produced
                within one growing season, mostly from fertilization via self-pollen (<renvoi idref="Sime and Baldwin, 2003" typeref="refbiblio"/>), and we can relate
                bud and flower production to lifetime seed production, which is commonly accepted as
                a measure of Darwinian fitness (<renvoi idref="Baldwin,&#xA;                    1998" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="van Loon et al., 2000" typeref="refbiblio"/>;
                    <renvoi idref="Hoballah and Turlings, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>).We
                hypothesized that HIPVs would increase plant reproduction by increasing predation of
                herbivores, and that TPIs alone would not increase reproduction under herbivore
                attack, but would either increase predation or increase herbivores' susceptibility
                to predators. We then assembled a toolbox of wild-type and transgenic lines chosen
                to test these hypotheses.</alinea>

            <alinea>We chose a genotype of <marquage typemarq="italique">N. attenuata</marquage> native to the Great Basin Desert
                of southwestern Utah. In many years, <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca</marquage> spp. larvae cause the

                naturally in the Utah habitat and are attracted to components of <marquage typemarq="italique">N.
                    attenuata</marquage>'s HIPV bouquet (<renvoi idref="Kessler and&#xA;                    Baldwin, 2001"

                Specifically, Utah <marquage typemarq="italique">Geocoris</marquage> spp. predators are attracted to the
                sesquiterpene (<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>)-&#x3b1;-bergamotene as well as green leaf volatiles
                (fatty acid-derived C6 aldehydes, alcohols and esters) (<renvoi idref="Kessler and Baldwin, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Halitschke et al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Schuman et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>). Green leaf volatiles,
                or GLVs, can be silenced via a single upstream 13-lipoxygenase,
                    Na<marquage typemarq="italique">LOX2</marquage>, which specifically supplies lipid hydroperoxides for
                their production (<renvoi idref="Allmann et al., 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>).
                Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage, the oral secretions (OS) of
                    <marquage typemarq="italique">M. sexta</marquage> convert 3-(<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-GLVs to the
                    2-(<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>)-structures, resulting in greater
                    <marquage typemarq="italique">Geocoris</marquage> spp. predation than the damage-induced
                    (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>):(<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>) ratio (<renvoi idref="Allmann and Baldwin, 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>). GLVs are released immediately upon
                damage (<renvoi idref="Allmann and Baldwin, 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>) and may
                therefore be a 'first line of defense'.</alinea>

            <para>
            <alinea>Like GLVs, many other HIPVs are also released after mechanical damage, but change in
                amount or ratio upon herbivory, and thus GLVs mirror the functional complexity of
                the total HIPV blend. Furthermore, GLVs prime or directly regulate responses in
                neighboring plants (<renvoi idref="Kessler et al., 2006" typeref="refbiblio"/>;
                    <renvoi idref="Paschold et al., 2006" typeref="refbiblio"/>), attract
                herbivores as well as predators (<renvoi idref="Halitschke et&#xA;                    al., 2008" typeref="refbiblio"/>), and are important cues for pollinating and ovipositing moths
                    (<renvoi idref="Kessler and Baldwin, 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>, <renvoi idref="2006" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="De&#xA;                    Moraes et al., 2001" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Fraser et al.,&#xA;                    2003" typeref="refbiblio"/>), thus performing several roles which may harm or benefit plant
                fitness in addition to their role in attracting predators. Perhaps most
                significantly, GLVs also stimulate <marquage typemarq="italique">Manduca</marquage> spp. feeding, and
                silencing plant GLV production results in reduced herbivore damage (<renvoi idref="Halitschke et al., 2004" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Meldau et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>). All these qualities
                made the manipulation of GLV emissions an ideal means to test rigorously the fitness
                consequences of HIPV emissions and to evaluate whether these emissions can truly be

                                volatile (GLV) pools, analyzed by GC-MS with a split ratio of 1/100
                                onto a nonpolar column; only (<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>)-hex-2-enal was
                                identified due to poor resolution of (<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>)-hex-2-enal
                                and (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-hex-3-en-1-ol on the nonpolar column; no

                                on a wax column. The dominant compound was

                                was also present in quantifiable amounts.
                                (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-3-hexenyl acetate was chosen as an internal
                                standard because no esters were detectable in the preliminary
                                qualitative GC-MS analysis (1A), and because its chemical similarity
                                to (<marquage typemarq="italique">E</marquage>)-hex-2-enal and
                                (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-hex-3-en-1-ol made it a good choice of internal
                                standard for normalization and calculation of yield from extracts.

                                forceps; and in a successful attack, the front end of the larva made
                                contact with the forceps, before returning to its original position.

                support indirect defense by weakening the response of larvae to predator attack.

                    It is common molecular biology knowledge that functional RNAi constructs may be
                    rendered ineffective as a result of insufficient gene dosage, for example, <renvoi idref="Travella et al. (2006)" typeref="refbiblio"/> and references

                    state (<renvoi idref="García-Pérez et al., 2004" typeref="refbiblio"/>). The
                    35S promoter which drives the transcription of the RNAi construct may also be
                    methylated: an epigenetic effect which can reduce the dose of RNAi in individual
                    plants within a single transformed line (A Weinhold, unpublished data). This may

                    seems always to be due to damage by insects (M C Schuman and I T Baldwin,
                    personal observation, June 2010). Plants are self-compatible and more than 70%
                    of seed set from plants in native populations results from fertilization via
                    self-pollen (<renvoi idref="Sime and Baldwin, 2003" typeref="refbiblio"/>).
                    Thus numbers of buds and flowers correlate to lifetime seed capsule production,

                    when removing reproductive meristems: meristems were cut at the bases of

               <alinea>By indicating the long-sought indirect defensive function of HIPVs, these data
                    set the stage for the use of HIPVs as part of integrated pest management
                    strategies (IPM), which rely in part on recruiting biological control agents to
                    reduce pesticide use (<renvoi idref="Horne and Page,&#xA;                        2008"
                          typeref="refbiblio"/>). These agents are usually naturally occurring generalist
                    parasitoids and predators, such as <marquage typemarq="italique">Geocoris</marquage> spp. (<renvoi idref="Eubanks and Denno, 1999" typeref="refbiblio"/>, <renvoi idref="2000" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Allison and Hare, 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>; <renvoi idref="Allmann and&#xA;                        Baldwin, 2010"
                          typeref="refbiblio"/>). HIPVs are produced by genotypes of most, if not all
                    crop plants and IPM would benefit from selective breeding or engineering of HIPV
                    emission (<renvoi idref="Kos et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>) rather than
                    relying on alternatives such as controlled release dispensers, which have mixed
                    success and require large amounts of synthetic HIPVs (<renvoi idref="Kaplan, 2012" typeref="refbiblio"/>). PIs may be employed to enhance the
                    efficiency of indirect defense, especially combined with toxins like Bt that
                    directly target herbivores and are safe for biological control agents. With
                    growing concerns about field-evolved Bt resistance (<renvoi idref="Liu et al., 2010" typeref="refbiblio"/>), indirect defenses promise an effective
                    'first line of defense' against agricultural pests, to which not even specialist
                    herbivores are likely to rapidly evolve resistance.</alinea>

               <alinea>To assess qualitatively the GLV pools in leaf tissue from field-grown plants, and
                    to determine appropriate amounts of leaf tissue and internal standard (IS) for
                    GLV extraction, we extracted pooled samples from leaves collected June 6, 2011,
                    from <marquage typemarq="italique">M. sexta</marquage>-infested plants during infestation M3 (<renvoi idref="Figure 4" typeref="refbiblio"/>). Each sample was pooled from all
                    leaves collected from one genotype. Hexane (300 µL) was added to 100 mg tissue
                    spiked with 3 µg tetralin as an internal standard (IS) and incubated by rotating
                    at RT overnight. Samples were allowed to settle and 100 µL of water- and
                    tissue-free hexane was transferred to a GC vial containing a 250 µL microinsert.
                    Individual analytes were analyzed by a Varian CP-3800 GC-Saturn 4000 ion trap MS
                    connected to a ZB5 column (30 m×0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 &#x3bc;m film thickness;
                    Phenomenex). 1 &#x3bc;L of samples was injected by a CP-8400 autoinjector (Varian)
                    onto the column with a 1:10 split ratio; the injector was returned to a 1:70
                    split ratio from 2 min after injection through the end of each run. The GC was
                    programmed as follows: injector held at 250°C, initial column temperature at
                    40°C held for 5 min, then ramped at 5°C/min to 185°C and finally at 30°C/min to
                    300°C, held for 0.17 min. Helium carrier gas was used and the column flow set to
                    1 mL/min. Compounds eluted from the GC column were transferred to the MS for
                    analysis. The MS was programmed as follows: transfer line at 250°C, trap
                    temperature 110°C, manifold temperature 50°C, source heater 200°C and scan range
                    from 40 to 399 m/z at 1.33 spectra per second as previously described (<renvoi idref="Schuman et al., 2009" typeref="refbiblio"/>). The identification
                    of compounds was conducted by GC retention time compared to pure standards and
                    mass spectra compared to standards and mass spectra databases, Wiley version 6

               <alinea>For the quantification of GLV pools in leaf tissue from field-grown plants, the
                    hexane extraction protocol was adjusted based on GC-MS results from pooled
                    samples (described above), and a GC-FID with a wax column was used for the
                    quantitative analysis of extracts. Hexane (300 µL) were added to 50 mg tissue
                    (N=10) spiked with 15 µg (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-hex-3-enyl acetate, a GLV not
                    found in GC-MS samples, as an IS. The extraction proceeded as described above.
                    Analytes were separated by Varian CP-3800 GC-FID connected to a ZB-Wax column
                    (30 m×0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 &#x3bc;m film thickness; Phenomenex). 1 &#x3bc;L of samples was

                    the injector was returned to a 1:70 split ratio 2 min after injection through
                    the end of each run. The GC was programmed as follows: injector held at 230°C,
                    initial column temperature at 40°C held for 7 min, then ramped at 5°C/min to
                    115°C and finally at 30°C/min to 250°C, held for 0.5 min. Helium carrier gas was
                    used and the column flow set to 1 mL/min. Compounds eluted from the GC column
                    were transferred to a Varian FID set at 250°C for analysis (airflow 300 mL/min,
                    hydrogen 30 mL/min, nitrogen make-up gas 5 mL/min). Individual volatile compound
                    peaks were quantified by peak areas using MS Work Station Method Builder and
                    Batch Report software (Varian) and normalized to the peak area of the IS
                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">Z</marquage>)-hex-3-enyl acetate in each sample. Peak identification
                    and quantification was done by comparison to standard curves of pure compounds

               <alinea>For measurement of GLVs in the headspace of field-grown plants, intact leaves
                    were harvested (N=3) and kept fresh by placing the petioles in microcentrifuge
                    tubes filled with water. Immediately before each measurement, one leaf was
                    treated with W+OS, and a 1 cm2 disc was stamped out and placed in a 4
                    mL GC vial. After 15 min, the headspace in the vial was measured with a ZNose
                    4200 portable gas chromatograph with a 1 m DB5 column (Electronic Sensor
                    Technology, Newbury Park, CA, USA) by inserting the ZNose inlet needle through
                    the septum of the GC vial into the headspace. The program was as follows: valve
                    set at 165°C, inlet at 200°C, trap at 250°C; 30 s sampling time, column ramped
                    from 30°C to 190°C at 4°C/s, data collection for 20 s. Genotypes were analyzed
                    in an alternating order within each replicate: first replicate 1 of all
                    genotypes, then replicate 2, then replicate 3. Retention times of GLV aldehydes
                    and alcohols, the most abundant GLV headspace components, were determined using

                    to 180°C and finally at 10°C/min to 240°C, held for 1 min. Helium carrier gas
                    was used and the column flow set to 1 mL/min. Eluted compounds from the GC
                    column were transferred to the MS for analysis. The MS was programmed as

                    by the total number of leaves. Leaf area damage was estimated in categories of

         <alinea>The hypothesis outlined in the title of this paper, that indirect defences in the
                form of herbivory-induced volatiles increase plant fitness, is being continuously
                discussed in the literature, without there being much definitive evidence for this
                phenomenon occurring in nature. It is a difficult hypothesis to test, but the
                authors of this work make a big step toward providing an answer.</alinea>

                complemented with lab experiments, the authors examined how emission of volatile
                organic compounds (VOCs) and a protease inhibitor (TPI) that reduces digestibility
                of plant tissue affect herbivore growth and plant fitness, as measured by flower
                buds and seed set in tobacco. The experimental approach was to reduce VOCs by
                silencing the <marquage typemarq="italique">LOX2</marquage> gene, and TPI activity by silencing the PI

                makes unfortunately in several places for difficult reading. In addition, the paper
                is extremely densely written and difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with the
                research program of the authors. To make the content of the work more accessible,
                the paper should be presented with separate sections for introduction, results, and
                discussion, and subsections for the results. In addition, the supplementary figures
                as well as the supplementary narrative should be integrated into the main text, and
                the data should be better and more consistently presented in the figures. For

                    measurements, including ones that are not easily explained or fit the hypotheses
                    examined. This makes unfortunately in several places for difficult reading. In
                    addition, the paper is extremely densely written and difficult to follow for
                    those unfamiliar with the research program of the authors. To make the content
                    of the work more accessible, the paper should be presented with separate
                    sections for introduction, results, and discussion, and subsections for the
                    results. In addition, the supplementary figures as well as the supplementary
                    narrative should be integrated into the main text, and the data should be better
                    and more consistently presented in the figures. For example, the colour code for
                    different genotypes in Fig. S1-3 and 6A,B should also be applied in all other
                    figures</marquage>.</alinea>

         <alinea>We recognize that this is a long, complex, and data-heavy manuscript. However, we
                feel that the behavior data is essential to the story, because it is the only effect
                we found of TPIs, and it is a novel effect which is highly relevant for the
                efficiency of indirect defense. Both because of the experimental designs presented
                in the paper, and because of the implications of these results, we feel they belong
                as part of this story. Also, if these data were not included, we would have to
                re-analyze all experiments without the ir<marquage typemarq="italique">PI</marquage> line, which we feel is
                artificial. The removal of these data would only save one figure and 3.5 paragraphs
